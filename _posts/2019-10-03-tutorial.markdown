Just uncheck this at "Character>Full Auto" Blueprint.

To use utility just simply make existing examples duplicate then run utility widget.<br>
Only after you have started the widget you should select the weapon you want to modify in the level editor.<br>

More tutorials may be put here as requested.<br>
As for now you can get help on discord: https://discord.gg/xF65E9P<br>

If anyone has a problem crosshair not returning to original position there is an easy fix for that.<br>
Go to Character=>Event Graph (Blueprint) and there you should find "Set Recoil".<br>
Set it to TRUE or vice versa.<br>
